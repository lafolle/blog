                Problem occured when i was handling servers and had to run a command for specific period of time,
                get its output and analyze.

                gtc is a computer program which runs a command for a specific period of time and then kills it.
                This blog post is a code walkthrough of gtc.

                <h3>Usage</h3>

                <p>An instance of usage looks like this: <code>gtc -t=3s -s ls -R /</code> which lists contents of root directory recursively for at max 3 seconds. The <code>-t</code> argument tells gtc for how long the given command should run, <code>-s</code> argumet tells gtc whether to preserve return exit status of given command or not.</p>

                <p>By default, <code>-t</code> is around 288 years, which is same as the maximum range of duration Go can handle. <code>-s</code> is <var>false</var>, ie gtc will return its own exit status rather than that of the commmand it runs.</p>
